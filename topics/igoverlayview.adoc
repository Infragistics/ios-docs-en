image::images/What's_New_in_2013_Volume_2_9.png[]

The  _IGOverlayView_   is a powerful and extremely flexible control for displaying any type of view that will overlay another view, with or without animation, when shown or dismissed. A total of 12 overlay animations are included, with 2 of these animation types allowing for custom animations limited by your imagination.

Adding views to overlay another view is a cinch, but if you require more than a quick and simple solution, the  _IGOverlayView_   was also designed to be extended upon. By deriving from the  _IGOverlayView_   class, you can tap into your creative psyche while using the  _IGOverlayView_   to help push your app to the next level.
