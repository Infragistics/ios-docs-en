=== Introduction

Markers are symbols (circular colored shapes) overlaid on the  _IGSparklineView_   indicating individual data points based on X/Y ordered pair coordinates.

All markers are set to display, by default, and are customizable to appear in a variety of colors by setting the marker’s brush property to an  _IGBrush_  . Set the marker’s visibility property to `YES` or `NO` to toggle rendering of the marker on or off respectively.
