=== Hiding Invalid Data in the Financial Price Series

OHLC points have always been allowed to show in the chart regardless of the underlying values. However, a financial chart should not show points where the low value is greater than high value. In 2015 Volume 1, the OHLC data source helper has updated functionality to hide invalid data values.
