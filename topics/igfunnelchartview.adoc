== About IGFunnelChartView

The funnel chart view is a data visualization tool that displays funnel slices with progressively increasing or decreasing values. The shape of the funnel chart most often resembles an upside-down trapezoid. Funnel chart data is a collection of numeric values, and each slice represents one value. The funnel chart view supports multiple slice selection, tooltips, tap and long press gestures.
