== About IGSlideTabView

The  _IGSlideTabView_   allows you to easily create a tab item on any side of the contained view that slides out content when tapped or swiped. Customization options include a property named `useTabPadding` that allows you to provide padding around the `contentAreaView` so that your views are not overlapped by tabs, pulsing a tab item to draw attention and full flexibility to create your own tab view and tab content view.
