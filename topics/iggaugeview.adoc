== About IGGaugeView

image::images/Gauge.png[]

_IGGaugeView_   is a data visualization control, capable of displaying a gauge. It contains a number of visual elements, such as a scale with tickmarks and labels, a needle and a number of ranges. A scale is created by supplying `minimumValue` and `maximumValue` and a needle is created by setting `value` property. The needle can be set to any of the predefined shapes. The gauge also supports ranges, which provide visual cues for the scale.

The gauge has a backing shape. This shape is drawn behind the scale and acts as a background for the gauge. The backing can be circular, which turns the shape into a full circle, or it can be fitted, which makes it sweep the scale.

The gauge needle takes on one of the several predefined shapes. The needle can have a pivot shape, which is placed in the center of the gauge. The pivot shape also takes one of the predefined shapes. Pivot shapes that include an overlay or an underlay can have a separate pivot brush applied to the shape.
