== Introduction

=== Tab locations summary

Tab items can be placed on the bottom, left, top and right of the  _IGSlideTabView_  . The default tab item location is the top and can be changed by setting the `tabLocation` property found on the  _IGSlideTabItem_   instance. The `tabLocation` property supports the subsequent enumeration values:

* `IGSlideTabLocationTop`
* `IGSlideTabLocationBottom`
* `IGSlideTabLocationLeft`
* `IGSlideTabLocationRight`

The image below displays tab items on the top, right, bottom and left of the  _IGSlideTabView_  . As illustrated, each tab item is labeled with its location.

Once displayed tab items can have their `tabLocation` moved by simply setting its property to one of the supported enumerations.
