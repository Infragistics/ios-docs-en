_IGPieChartView_   is a data visualization tool that displays a circular graph containing sectors (slices). Pie chart data is a collection of numeric values, and each slice represents one value. Small values that fall below a user-defined threshold are grouped into the Others slice.

The pie chart view supports multiple slice selection and explosion, as well as tooltips, rotation, tap and long press gestures.
