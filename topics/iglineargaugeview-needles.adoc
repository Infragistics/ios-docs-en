=== Introduction

A linear gauge needle is a visual element used to signify a set value. The supported needle shapes shown in <<_Ref327864136,Needle shape types>> are set using the `needleShape` property. If `needleShape` is not set, the default needle `IGLinearGraphNeedleShapeTrapezoid` is used. The linear gauge needle can have its appearance customized through the following properties.

* `needleBrush`
* `needleInnerExtent`
* `needleOuterExtent`
* `needleOutline`
* `needleStrokeThickness`
