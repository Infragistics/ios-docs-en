== About IGProgressView

image::images/What's_New_in_2013_Volume_2_10.png[]

The  _IGProgressView_   is a multifaceted progress control capable of rendering standard, radial, or even custom progress shapes. In addition, to the  _IGProgressView_   looking great out of the box, nearly every part  _IGProgressView_   can be styled to look great in your app. Properties such as `progressTintColor` and `progressTrackTintColor` make it simple to adjust the color of the  _IGProgressView_  . Although, if you require finer tuning; `progressShapeLayer`, `progressTrackShapeLayer`, and `radialInsertShapeLayer` are exposed to give you complete control over the progress appearance all the way down to the stroke used. The styling doesn't stop at only visual appearance, the properties `progressAnimationDuration` and `progressAnimationTimingFunction` allow for polishing the animation that occurs when the progress changes value.
