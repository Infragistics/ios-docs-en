== About IGLinearGaugeView

image::images/What's_New_in_2013_Volume_2_8.png[]

_IGLinearGaugeView_   is a data visualization control, capable of displaying a linear gauge. It contains a number of visual elements, such as a scale with tickmarks and labels, a needle and a number of ranges. A scale is created by supplying `minimumValue` and `maximumValue` and a needle is created by setting value property. The needle can be set to any of the predefined shapes. The linear gauge also supports ranges, which provide visual cues for the scale. Additionally, the gauge has a backing shape. This shape is drawn behind the scale and acts as a background for the gauge.
