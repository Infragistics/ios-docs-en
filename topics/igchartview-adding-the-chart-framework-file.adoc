=== Introduction

This procedure provides step-by-step directions for adding the chart framework and if applicable the QuartzCore framework, both of which are required for using the  _IGChartView_™ control in your application.

[[_Ref323111426]]

=== Requirements

* To complete this procedure, you need the following:
** A new or existing Xcode iOS project
** The  _IGChart.framework_   folder stored locally on your machine

[[_Ref323111435]]

=== Steps

=== 1. Adding the Chart Framework File

a. Open or create an Xcode iOS project that will use the  _IGChartView_  .

b. On the  _Project Navigator_   pane, left click on the project name, which is the parent item visible in the  _Project Navigator’s_   tree view.

f. Repeat steps  *d*  and  *e*  to add the  _QuartzCore.framework_   if this is not already included in your project.

=== 2. Adding the Header File

a. Navigate and select the  _UIViewController’s_   header (.h) file that will use the  _IGChartView_  .

b. Add the import statement at the top of the source file:

*In Objective-C:*

[source,csharp]
----
#import <IGChart/IGChart.h>
----

c. The  _IGChartView_   is now available for use in your  _UIViewController_  .
