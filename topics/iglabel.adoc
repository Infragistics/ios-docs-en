== About IGLabel

image::images/Label.png[]

The  _IGLabel_   is a rich text label that works similarly to the generic  _UILabel_   and applies styles to text in a similar fashion that is done when using attributed strings. It is based on Core Text to boost performance and functionality over the generic  _UILabel_  .

Attributes are used to decorate the displayed text using an  _NSRange_   or a regular expression search string through these two methods; `addAttributes:range:`, and `addAttributes:forRegEx:error:`. Attributes allow you to adjust these text characteristics; bold appearance, font used, text foreground color, italic appearance, kern spacing, text stroke color and width, interaction of text through tap, and underline appearance and color.

Text variables are added by using the `addTextVariable:value:` method and are used to allow for the usage of dynamic text values. When the text property changes and text variables were defined, they are automatically updated with the configured value.
