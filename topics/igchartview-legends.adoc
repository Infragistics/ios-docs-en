== Introduction

=== Legend summary

Legends identify the name of a series or its elements represented in the chart plot area. The legend is a view that displays a series of legend items. Denoted by a colored icon and a label, each legend item represents a series in the chart view. The icon uses the series brush with the label being the series title. The legend can be positioned anywhere in the application’s view and does not have to be part of the chart view. Legends are linked to charts via the `legend` property either on the  _IGChartView_   or on a series. A single legend can be used to display some or all of the series in multiple chart views, although a series may only be bound to one legend view at a time.

.Note:
[NOTE]
====
If a series does not have a title property set, the label will contain the text, “Series Title” in the legend.

== Adding a Legend to a UIView – Code Example

[[_Ref326147531]]

=== Description

The following code creates an  _IGLegend_   instance and assigns it to the `legend` property on the  _IGChartView_   before adding the legend to the subview. With the `legend` property being set on the chart, the legend will contain items for every series that was added to the  _IGChartView_  .
