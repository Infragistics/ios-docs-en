== About IGChartView

A chart view is a data visualization control that creates a graphical representation of the user’s data. This control is designed to display high amounts of data and can handle constant data updates.

A chart view consists of two or more  _IGAxis_   objects and one or more  _IGSeries_   objects. The type of axes will depend on which series are used in the chart view. Each  _IGSeries_   object has a detailed description about axes requirements. The chart view supports an unlimited number of axes and an unlimited number of series. A typical chart view may include an  _IGCategoryXAxis_  , an  _IGNumericYAxis_   and a series such as  _IGColumnSeries_  .
